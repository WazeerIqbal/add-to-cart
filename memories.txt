Redux:
    In redux we manage our state
    1-We create a folder state inside a folder we create a another two folder
        a-action-creators (initiate action) - we create "index.js"
        b-reducers (reducers is a function which change our state) 
        
        "npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk" 
        we bring all our state in one place. For that i will create a bolier plate for this state.
